Java User Group Bangladesh (JUGBD) is a volunteer organization that strives to distribute Java-related knowledge. Our plan to provide a meeting place for a java user group to get information, share resources and solutions, increase networking, expands Java Technology expertise, and above all, drink coke, eat pizza and have fun.

The primary vision of JUGBD is to continue meeting on a very regular basis. As all the people are involved here are too much cool and enthusiastic, it always feels better to talk to each other and learning new things.

Nowadays, we mostly operate from a Facebook group: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/jugbd](https://www.facebook.com/groups/jugbd "https://www.facebook.com/groups/jugbd")

Join the group to follow all our activities.

Best,

Java User group Bangladesh
