We are doing great; it’s not an exaggeration.

For those who don't know what JUG is, let me brief you a little. Java User Groups (JUGs) are basically a group of enthusiastic people who love Java and develop products and services using Java-related technology and love to share their knowledge with others. We get together someplace and then talk to each other, eat, and have fun.

The primary vision of JUGBD is to continue meeting on a very regular basis. As all the people are involved here are too much cool and enthusiastic, it always feels better to talk to each other and learning new things.

In August 2013, we had our first meetup. On this day, we formed a group with a few Java programmers of different software firms and with some students, both of whom were present at the event. Later we decide to have another meetup, which was held on 6th December 2013. This time, we received a huge response from the programmers here in Dhaka, a lot of them were physically present, and most of them supported us. We had three speakers at this event. They gave a talk on how Java technology influenced other technology, big data (Cassandra), and JVM diagnostic. All of the talks were excellent.

A lot of software firm is stepping forward to help our events. Meetup 2.0 was sponsored by Therap Services, LLC. Besides, we got our sponsor for the next meetup already, which is really helpful to our community. We greatly appreciate this sort of help.

We are looking to contribute to some open-source projects, and thus we are looking for problems, ideas. Here is an open invitation to everybody: if you are a Java programmer, enthusiastic about learning new stuff, and love to talk about technologies, please join us. It’s a great opportunity for us to learn and grow.
