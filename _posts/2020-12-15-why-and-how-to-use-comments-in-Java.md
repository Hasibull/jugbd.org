## Why we use comments in program?

Commenting involves placing Human Readable Descriptions inside programs detailing what the Code is doing. Proper use of commenting can make code maintenance much easier, as well as helping make finding bugs faster. Comments are **not executed** by compiler.

## How to use comments in Java?

In Java, there are **three** types of comment-

- Single line comment.
- Multi line comment.
- Documentation comment.

## Single line comment:

---

The single line comment is used to comment only one line. Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//). Text after (//) this considered as comment.  
**Example:**

> // This is a single line comment.

## Multi line comment:

---

The multi line comment is used to comment multiple lines of code. Multi-line comments start with /_ and ends with_/. Any text between /_ and _/ will be ignored by Java.  
**Example:**

```
/*
 This is a
 multiline
 comment
*/
```

## Documentation comment:

---

The documentation comment is used to create documentation API. It's start with /** and end with \*/ .  
**Example:\*\*

```
/**
  This is
  documentation
  comment
*/
```
